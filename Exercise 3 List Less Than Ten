# Exercise 3 List Less Than Ten
# Take a list, say for example this one:  a_list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

a_list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

for i in a_list:
    if i < 5:
        print(i)
