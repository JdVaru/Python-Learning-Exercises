# Exercise 6 Rock Paper Scissors
# Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

# Remember the rules:

# 1 Rock beats scissors
# 2 Scissors beats paper
# 3 Paper beats rock


print('''Please pick one:
            rock
            scissors
            paper''')

        print('Wrong choice !!  Enter your choice again')
        continue
    player_b = str(input("Player b: "))
