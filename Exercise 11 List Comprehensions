# Exercise 11 List Comprehensions
# Write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the below two lists (without duplicates). 
# Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
# a_list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# b_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

c_list = list(set(x for x in a_list for y in b_list if x==y))
