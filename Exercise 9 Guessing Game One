# Exercise 9 Guessing Game One
# Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9).
# Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.
# Hint: User randint function of random module to generate random numbers

import random
while True:
    num=int(input('What\'s your guess? '))
    a_rand=random.randint(1,9)
    if num == a_rand:
        print('Perfect guess !')
    elif num > a_rand:
        print('Too High !')
    else:
        print('Too Low !')
    if input('Do you want to try again? y or n: ') != 'y':
       break

print('Have a good day ahead !')


Output:
What's your guess? 5
Too High !
Do you want to try again? y or n: n
